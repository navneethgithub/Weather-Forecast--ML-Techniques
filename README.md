# Weather-Forecast--ML-Techniques

## INTRODUCTION
Temperature prediction involves the formulating and disseminating information about future temperature conditions of a given area at a given time.
Machine learning holds a great promise for temperature predictions.This helps models to provide better account for prediction inaccuracies and produce more accurate predictions.
<br />
There are numerous kinds of machine learning calculations which are linear regression,polynomial regression,random forest regression,artificial neural network and recurrent neural network.these models are prepared based on the authentic information of any area.

## OBJECTIVE
•	To analyse the temperature conditions to predict the temperature using different algorithms like linear regression and decision tree regression.
<br />
•	To study various factors like humidity, windspeed, uv-index etc  that can influence the  temperature of the area.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset utilized in this analysis has been gathered from visualcrossing.com which is “Historical Weather Data and Weather Forecast Data" from which we have chosen the data for Kerala. The datasets contain daily weather data from 01-01-2020 to 31-05-2022.

## METHODOLOGY
##### Data Collection & Cleaning
##### Exploratory Data Analysis
##### Data Visualisation
##### Machine Learning Techniques.

## MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
A machine learning model is defined as a mathematical representation of the output of the training process. It is the study of different algorithms that can improve automatically through experience & old data and build the model. 
### •	Linear Regression
 In regression problems, the output is a continuous variable.Linear regression is the simplest machine learning model in which we try to predict one output variable using one or more input variables.
The main aim of the linear regression model is to find the best fit line that best fits the data points. 
### •	Decision Tree Regression
Decision trees are widely used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, strategic planning, and mainly in machine learning. A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm. It is a graphical representation of all the possible solutions. 

## CONCLUSION
Machine Learning is a buzzword in the technology world right now and for good reason, it represents a major step forward in how computers can learn. 
It should be noted here that this study is the attempt to investigate the performance of the machine learning modeling to predict the Temperature  in Kerala by analysing the temperature beginning from 2020 to present year  and hence, it is necessary to examine the performance of different machine learning modeling methods
